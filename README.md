# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Economics and Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is a required course but I am excited to take it anyway!
- I am interested in learning about R this semester in an in-depth way.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:

# Part A (Where the wild things are):

- Pizza on pineapple to be or not to be, that is the question.
* I miss renting movies from video eazy as a kid...
